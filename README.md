# MediScribe
MediScribe uses Microsoft's Speech to Text API to transcribe what a doctor is saying, while highlighting, defining, and translating medical terminology. The transcription is stored in MongoDB to keep records of the appointment and also allows the user to send the transcription to others via the Twilio SendGrid API.
